## About Me
Hi there, I'm EH-Sora and I mainly do art and make not super organized and unfocused YouTube videos and don't really have consistent upload schedule.

English isn't my native languge, Swedish is and struggle a lot without auto correct (and me having dyslexia dosen't help).

I did study game design in high school and dumb as rocks at times when I don't see what the issue is (usually I misspelled  something and don't see it).

I'm curious by nature and love to learn about stuff.
and figued out very basic HTML and CSS by myself.

I have been using Linux on and off for almost a decade and been daily driven Linux for 3-4 when I got to know the system requierments for Windows 11.

I like tinkering, take apart and build stuff to learn about it.
I didn't have a lot of money when growing up and learnd how to fix, modify and reuse to keep it alive longer.

My main machines are my ancient mid 2012 MacBook Air that is running Fedora Linux and Hyprland as my secondary device, a beat up unibody mid 2012 MacBook Pro I use for editing and Photoshop.

I'm working on picking up game design/development again becouse it was something I really enjoyed doing in high school.

I want to build a HomeLab or more of a propper server, but I don't know what I want to put into it and what I would use it for.

I'm very open to "right to repair" and we should be repair and fix our own stuff and really like what Framwork is doing and working on saving up for a maxed out Framwork 16 as my main work machine.

I work with "wood working" and learned about computers and networking and things like that by necessity (and I'm to cheap to pay someone to fix something I could do myself).

I can setup a basic media server, but can't get Samba working as it should.

I'm willing to learn and if I have some kind of external push and a interested in something I can keep working on it.

I will update the README as I go and learn how to format things
