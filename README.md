## Hi there, I'm EH-Sora ðŸ‘‹
***I will update things as I go***

## About Me
Hi there, I'm EH-Sora and I mainly do art and make not super organized and unfocused YouTube videos.

I don't really have consistent upload schedule and do a bit whatever I feel like making.
<br/>English isn't my native languge, Swedish is and struggle a lot with read and write due to having dyslexia.

I drink a lot of tea and masure in liters, I usully drink quite strong black tea with honey and don't care if it's still hot or not.

# _My Background_
I did study game design in high school and was more skilled in the art and 3D-modeling parts.
<br/>I can some basic C# get somewhat working prototypes in Unity to get what I want to do across, but I'm really rusty on how things work, due to being about 7 years since I did game design/development and a lot has changed and I forgot how to do.

I'm dumb as rocks at times and get stuck at very simple things, usually I misspelled something and don't see it where it is.

I'm very creative, but can run into a brick wall where I can get multiple sketches out of a idea, but can sit and slam my head against the wall becouse something doesn't click and in my head and I will be stuck for weeks on it.

I'm quite all over the place and struggle with keeping things organized and keep track of things and time (ADHD in a nutshell, medicated but still all over the place).

I'm curious by nature and love to learn about stuff, as well love to fix and repair, modify and reuse things.

# _What Gear I use_
The computers I use is quite old and would be in need of replacement if I want to do more game design/development or more general dev work.
<br/>But due to not having a lot of money to spend on new laptops or computer parts, so do I have to do the best with 10+ year old computers.

**Main desktop computer**
A budget build that took me 2.5 years to save up to and built it sometime in 2017 (I will add the specs later).
<br/> I built it for more editing power and being able to play games with my friends.

[The Specs]
<br/>CPU: Intel i5?
<br/>CPU Fan: ?
<br/>Motherboard: Asus ?
<br/>GPU: Intel graphics ? (Had A Asus AMD Radeon HD 7770 Dual-Fan 2GB)
<br/>PSU: Corsair 550W ?
<br/>Case: Fractal Design Define R5
<br/>RAM: 8GB DDR4 ?
<br/>Boot Drive: WD Green 128GB m.2 SSD?
<br/>Bulk Storage: 1TB Seagate Baracuda, 2TB Seagate Baracuda
<br/>Optical Drive: Asus ?
<br/>Miss Stuff: cheap Bluetooth USB, Asus Wi-Fi PCIe card?
<br/>OS: NixOS with KDE Plasma (Going to swithch to Fedora Linux with Hyprland)

**Laptops in use**
<br/>[Mid 2012 13'3" MacBook Air]
<br/>I got a mid 2012 13'3" MacBook Air from my high school in 2015 and later bought it from the school.
<br/>I have draged that MacBook Air everywhere for 10 years and been a cornerstone for me in YouTube and learning.

It running today Fedora Linux and hyprland and acts as my secondary device

[Mid 2012 13'3" unibody MacBook Pro]
<br/>A beat up unibody Macbook Pro I bought for editing and Photoshop and spent more on parts then what I paid for it.

# _My Skill Set_
I'm some what skilled in a lot and would need to brush up on things more.
<br/>[**Programing Languges**]
* C# (Really rusty, but mainly with Unity and "Mono Behavior")
* HTML (Some what self learned, but really basic)
* CSS (Some what self learned, but really basic)
* JavaScript (Only some basics)
<br/>[**Video, Sound & Softwares**]
* Video editing (Self taught, due to YouTube)
* Sound mixing (Some what self taught and school)
* Blender (Some what self taught)
* Photoshop CS6 (Some what self taught and school)

* Basic understanding of networking and servers (Can setup a basic media server)
* Basic electronic understanding (Can build and fix small and simple stuff)
* 
# _What's on my "To Do" learning list_
I have a quite long "To-Do and Learning" list and due to not working with tech and software, so are my learning a bit diffrent.
**<br/>[Things I have laying around that neet to be fixed]**
* Wierd Xbox 360 controller (Cable need to be replaced)
* PS4 controller (Need new battery, and springs for the triggers)
* Multiple Bluetooth headphones (Multiple Bluetooth headphones with diffrent issues)
* USB-C convertion on a crappy Acer laptop (Just annying to deal with clunky laptop charger & SSD swap)
* What's wrong with my Toshiba laptop (It boot loops)
* Fix PS4 (It doesn't boot correctlly, but works)

<br/>**[Programing Languges & Software]**
* _C#_ (A more general knowledge of use & more wide use outside of game dev)
* _Godot_ (Becouse I refuse using Unity)
* _CSS_ (A better general knowledge and more advance things)
* _HTML_ (A better general knowledge and more advance things)
* _C++_ (Why not and something that could be good to know)
* _C_ (Why not and something that could be good to know)
* _COBOL_ (Why not and something that could be good to know & just for fun)
* _JavaScrit_ (I don't like JavaScript, but it's something good to know)
* _Java_ (I don't know how much it diffrence from JavaScript)
* Brush up on _Blender_ (Been awhile and a lot of versions since I used it "daily")
* _Photoshop_ (Animation & Pixle Art) (I can handle Photoshop, but need to learn more)
* Some basic music theory & music writting (aka not randomly hit keys in Logic Pro and go by "feel" and figure things out)
  
# _Projects I'm working on_
***A Silly Wizerd Game***
<br/>A small project where I brush up my knowledge in C# in game dev and learning Godot (C#/DOTNET), becouse Unity crash my MacBook Air.
<br/>The original goal was to have a "working prototype" done by July 21st (2025) and work as away to kill time, but due to reasons so did my timeline fall apart.

The game is basiclly for me to "relearn" C#, learning pixel art and animation, Godot (a bit of a pain) and music.
<br/>The main thing is I have locked myself to use my MacBook Air and phone for getting the bulk done, my MacBook Pro just for Photoshop.

# _Projects I'm thinking about_
The large project I'm thinking about doing, but have to wait due to cost.
<br/>I have been wantining to build a "mini rack" and have a compact general use server.

I don't know what I want to put into it, but most likely a some kind of Raspberry Pi based web radio box, general use Mac Mini and mini PC, as well file server and media server.

# _Gear Upgrades_
My gear I use is getting really old and in need of an upgrade.
* A well speced Framework 16 laptop (would be my main work machine)
* A M4 MacBook Air (Personal use and to run more up to date software
* A propper NAS (aka something that's just "Plug-n-Play" and not something that "kinda work")
-----------------------------------Not Fixed-----------------------------------------------------------------------



I have been using Linux on and off for almost a decade and been daily driven Linux for 3-4 when I got to know the system requierments for Windows 11.

I like tinkering, take apart and build stuff to learn about it.
I didn't have a lot of money when growing up and learnd how to fix, modify and reuse to keep it alive longer.

I want to build a HomeLab or more of a propper server, but I don't know what I want to put into it and what I would use it for.

I'm very open to "right to repair" and we should be repair and fix our own stuff and really like what Framwork is doing and working on saving up for a maxed out Framwork 16 as my main work machine.

I work with "wood working" and learned about computers and networking and things like that by necessity (and I'm to cheap to pay someone to fix something I could do myself).

I can setup a basic media server, but can't get Samba working as it should.

I'm willing to learn and if I have some kind of external push and a interested in something I can keep working on it.

I will update the README as I go and learn how to format things

## To-Do
1. Make it readable
2. Who I am
3. Better orgenized
4. What I know and can do?
5. What I what to learn
