## Hi there, I'm EH-Sora ðŸ‘‹
***I will update things as I go***

## About Me
Hi there, I'm EH-Sora and I mainly do art and make not super organized and unfocused YouTube videos.

I don't really have consistent upload schedule and do a bit whatever I feel like making.
<br/>English isn't my native languge, Swedish is and struggle a lot with read and write due to having dyslexia.

I drink a lot of tea and masure in liters, I usully drink quite strong black tea with honey and don't care if it's still hot or not.

# _My Background_
I did study game design in high school and was more skilled in the art and 3D-modeling parts.
<br/>I can some basic C# get somewhat working prototypes in Unity to get what I want to do across, but I'm really rusty on how things work, due to being about 7 years since I did game design/development and a lot has changed and I forgot how to do.

I'm dumb as rocks at times and get stuck at very simple things, usually I misspelled something and don't see it where it is.

I'm very creative, but can run into a brick wall where I can get multiple sketches out of a idea, but can sit and slam my head against the wall becouse something doesn't click and in my head and I will be stuck for weeks on it.

I'm quite all over the place and struggle with keeping things organized and keep track of things and time (ADHD in a nutshell, medicated but still all over the place).

I'm curious by nature and love to learn about stuff, as well love to fix and repair, modify and reuse things.

# _What Gear I use_
The computers I use is quite old and would be in need of replacement if I want to do more game design/development or more general dev work.
<br/>But due to not having a lot of money to spend on new laptops or computer parts, so do I have to do the best with 10+ year old computers.

**Main desktop computer**
A budget build that took me 2.5 years to save up to and built it sometime in 2017 (I will add the specs later).
<br/> I built it for more editing power and being able to play games with my friends.

**Laptops in use**
<br/>[Mid 2012 13'3" MacBook Air]
<br/>I got a mid 2012 13'3" MacBook Air from my high school in 2015 and later bought it from the school.
<br/>I have draged that MacBook Air everywhere for 10 years and been a cornerstone for me in YouTube and learning.

It running today Fedora Linux and hyprland and acts as my secondary device

[Mid 2012 13'3" unibody MacBook Pro]
<br/>A beat up unibody Macbook Pro I bought for editing and Photoshop and spent more on parts then what I paid for it.

# _My Skill Set_
I'm some what skilled in a lot and would need to brush up on things more.
<br/>[**Programing Languges**]
* C# (Really rusty, but mainly with Unity and "Mono Behavior")
* HTML (Some what self learned, but really basic)
* CSS (Some what self learned, but really basic)
* JavaScript (Only some basics)
<br/>[**Video, Sound & Softwares**]
* Video editing (Self taught, due to YouTube)
* Sound mixing (Some what self taught and school)
* Blender (Some what self taught)
* Photoshop CS6 (Some what self taught and school)

* Basic understanding of networking and servers (Can setup a basic media server)
* Basic electronic understanding (Can build and fix small and simple stuff)
* 
# _What's on my "To Do" learning list_
-----------------------------------Not Fixed-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I pickup stuff and learn about things as I go and need it, a huge reason why I have huge gaps in diffrent languages.

I did learn some C# adn Unity in high school and basiclly get meltdown if I need to do something outside of C# and in Unity and think quite slowly.

I'm working to have a better understending of C# and how to use it to build programs, I basiclly figued out very basic HTML and CSS by myself and used tutorials when I get stuck.

I know a bit of JavaScript, but struggle a lot due to text and I don't mix well.
The plan is to learn C# for general use, figure out how to use HTML and CSS to create "web guis" to make things easier.
Learn C, C++ and COBOL for "fun" and pickup things when I need.

I have been using Linux on and off for almost a decade and been daily driven Linux for 3-4 when I got to know the system requierments for Windows 11.

I like tinkering, take apart and build stuff to learn about it.
I didn't have a lot of money when growing up and learnd how to fix, modify and reuse to keep it alive longer.

My main machines are my ancient mid 2012 MacBook Air that is running Fedora Linux and Hyprland as my secondary device, a beat up unibody mid 2012 MacBook Pro I use for editing and Photoshop.

I'm working on picking up game design/development again becouse it was something I really enjoyed doing in high school.

I want to build a HomeLab or more of a propper server, but I don't know what I want to put into it and what I would use it for.

I'm very open to "right to repair" and we should be repair and fix our own stuff and really like what Framwork is doing and working on saving up for a maxed out Framwork 16 as my main work machine.

I work with "wood working" and learned about computers and networking and things like that by necessity (and I'm to cheap to pay someone to fix something I could do myself).

I can setup a basic media server, but can't get Samba working as it should.

I'm willing to learn and if I have some kind of external push and a interested in something I can keep working on it.

I will update the README as I go and learn how to format things

## To-Do
1. Make it readable
2. Who I am
3. Better orgenized
4. What I know and can do?
5. What I what to learn
